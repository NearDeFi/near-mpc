# Published Attestation Crate from NEAR ONE MPC

Original crate here:
https://github.com/near/mpc/tree/main/crates/attestation

This fork seeks to publish the attestation crate as a standalone.

Features added for use in the shade agent stack, while keeping as much parity with NEAR ONE attestation logic at possible.
